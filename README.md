# Docker Monitoring Setup with Chef

This Chef cookbook automates the setup of a Docker-based monitoring environment, which includes an NGINX-HAProxy service and Prometheus for monitoring OS metrics.

## Prerequisites

- **Chef**: Ensure Chef is installed on your system.
- **Docker**: This cookbook will install Docker if itâ€™s not already installed.

## Cookbook Details

This cookbook performs the following tasks:

1. **Install Docker**: Ensures Docker is installed and running.
2. **Create Docker Network**: Creates a private Docker network named `private-net`.
3. **Pull and Run NGINX-HAProxy Container**:
   - Image: `a4ayan/nginx-haproxy:2`
   - Ports: `80:80` (for NGINX) and `9100:9100` (for Node Exporter metrics)
   - Network: `private-net`
4. **Pull and Run Prometheus Container**:
   - Image: `prom/prometheus:latest`
   - Port: `9090:9090` (for Prometheus web UI)
   - Network: `private-net`
   - Volume: Mounts a custom `prometheus.yml` configuration file

## Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd docker-monitoring
```
Step 2: Customize Prometheus Configuration
Ensure that your prometheus.yml file is correctly configured to scrape metrics from the Node Exporter running in the NGINX-HAProxy container. Place your prometheus.yml file in the prometheus-config directory.

Step 3: Run the Chef Recipe
Use the following command to execute the Chef recipe:

```bash
chef-solo -c docker-monitoring/solo.rb -j docker-monitoring/web.json
```
Step 4: Access the Services
NGINX-HAProxy: Access the service at http://localhost:80
Prometheus: Access the Prometheus dashboard at http://localhost:9090

## Conclusion
This cookbook simplifies the process of setting up a Docker-based monitoring solution with NGINX-HAProxy and Prometheus.
